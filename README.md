# ExtStringCase
#### String Casing Helper
**Beta version**
***

String Casing Utility for converting strings to and from different casing styles,
this NPM Package came to be since I found myself using 4 half baked packages
in order to achieve these conversions.
 
###### Following casing styles are supported,
* Pascal
* Camel
* Snake
* Dash

there are also a bunch convenience/helper methods for dealing with strings.

###### Following methods are shaky
These are still in an early **Beta** stage, these methods will detect the
input format and perform the conversion accordingly.
 
```typescript
toDashCase
toPascalCase
toCamelCase
```

##### Examples
```typescript
toDashCase
toPascalCase
toCamelCase
```

##### Helper Methods
In order to perform these conversions a few helper methods was
born as well and can be used independently of the conversion methods.

* Pascal
* Camel
* Snake
* Dash

####Unit Testing
Unit tests is available for the most of the methods :)
